# UI Analysis (October 30, 2025)

This folder consolidates the latest UI research and evaluation for Energy Planet's mini app. Use it as the single source of truth for:

- Industry-aligned best practices that should guide design and implementation decisions.
- The current-state audit of the shipped Telegram Mini App UI with supporting code references.
- Prioritised recommendations and next steps to evolve the experience.

Documents are numbered chronologically so that newcomers can follow the story:

1. `00_best-practices.md` – distilled research from recent UI/UX guidance.
2. `01_current-state.md` – what works today and where the UI falls short.
3. `02_recommendations.md` – backlog of fixes with owners, effort estimates, and success signals.
4. `03_research-backlog.md` – open questions, testing ideas, and dependencies.

Update cadence: review after every major release (or at least once per sprint) so archived analyses stay current.
