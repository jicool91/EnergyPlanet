# 00 · Best Practices Snapshot (October 30, 2025)

This briefing captures the latest guidance on running effective UI audits and applying findings to Energy Planet's Telegram mini app.

## 1. Frame Objectives, Metrics, and Methods
- Document business and user KPIs (e.g., conversion, retention, churn) before auditing so improvements can be measured against a baseline. Frameworks like HEART or AARRR help keep teams aligned on what success looks like. citeturn2search6
- Blend qualitative walkthroughs with quantitative telemetry instead of relying on one signal. Mixed methods surface issues earlier and produce higher-quality fixes. citeturn0search0

## 2. Use Structured Evaluation Techniques
- Run heuristic reviews anchored in Nielsen's usability heuristics to reveal interaction and feedback gaps quickly. citeturn2search6
- Facilitate pluralistic walkthroughs (designers + engineers + users) to step through real tasks together; the method uncovers more issues by combining perspectives early in the lifecycle. citeturn2search16

## 3. Prioritise Accessibility from the Start
- Audit color contrast, keyboard flows, screen-reader semantics, and mobile behaviours during every review to guarantee WCAG 2.2 AA coverage and inclusive experiences. citeturn2search1
- Pair automated tooling (e.g., Accessibility Insights) with real user tests that rely on assistive tech; automation alone misses high-impact gaps. citeturn2search1

## 4. Strengthen Visual Hierarchy & Navigation
- Diagnose contrast, typography, and CTA prominence issues; adjust accent colors and grouping to guide focus and support scannability. citeturn2search3
- Restructure overloaded navigation and duplicate CTAs so every entry point has a clear, distinct purpose. citeturn2search3

## 5. Cluster Findings and Drive Action
- Group observations by theme (navigation, interaction, performance) and prioritise them by impact vs. effort to separate quick wins from strategic bets. citeturn2search5
- Translate audit outputs into concrete tasks with owners and due dates; an audit that stops at a PDF rarely changes the UX. citeturn2search5

## 6. Tooling to Support the Workflow
- Combine behaviour analytics (GA4) with qualitative UX platforms (Maze, Optimal Workshop) and accessibility toolchains to cover the full spectrum from discovery to validation. citeturn2search0
