# UI Remediation Roadmap (Updated: 2025-11-15)

| Priority | Problem | Reference | Task / Fix Strategy | Owner | Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Live metrics on TapScreen are invisible to assistive tech and confuse localization ("Tap!"). | [TapScreen – element findings](./screens/TapScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Add i18n keys for hero badges + wrap energy/multiplier values in `aria-live` regions with reduced-motion guards. | Design Systems + Frontend | Sprint 46 |
| P0 | Shop tablist breaks keyboard navigation, hurting conversion for desktop / accessibility users. | [ShopScreen – element findings](./screens/ShopScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Implement ARIA tablist pattern with roving focus + arrow keys; localize hero copy. | Webapp Frontend | Sprint 46 |
| P0 | Admin monetization page lacks sticky headers and mixes player analytics with admin view, slowing ops. | [AdminMonetizationScreen – element findings](./screens/AdminMonetizationScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Add sticky table header + sparkline stats and swap `ShopPanel` with lightweight preview to cut load time. | BI + Internal Tools | Sprint 47 |
| P1 | Referral error CTA launches invite share instead of retry, blocking support when API fails. | [FriendsScreen – element findings](./screens/FriendsScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Split retry vs invite flows, disable invite when quota exceeded, and fix leaderboard CTA scroll. | Growth Frontend | Sprint 47 |
| P1 | Chat composer lacks label/counter and new message pill is silent, breaching WCAG. | [ChatScreen – element findings](./screens/ChatScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Add visible label + live counter, implement `aria-live` for new message notifications, introduce virtualization for long lists. | Social Frontend | Sprint 46 |
| P1 | Season screen reward claim errors still use `alert` and leaderboard heading misreports list size. | [SeasonScreen – element findings](./screens/SeasonScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Replace alert with toast/inline error, always render rewards empty state, and fix leaderboard copy/pagination. | LiveOps | Sprint 47 |
| P1 | PvP events + airdrop screens ship with mock data; players cannot trust schedules. | [PvPEventsScreen – element findings](./screens/PvPEventsScreen.md#element-level-findings), [AirdropScreen – element findings](./screens/AirdropScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Wire both screens to real APIs/feature flags, add timezone labels, and surface CTAs (queue/join, set reminder). | Events Squad | Sprint 48 |
| P2 | Clan tab is dead-end copy without waitlist or telemetry. | [ClanScreen – element findings](./screens/ClanScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Replace placeholder with signup CTA + teaser content, fire exposure event, and tighten layout. | Social Systems | Sprint 48 |
| P2 | Profile screen over-announces entire layout due to broad `aria-live` and lacks deep links to settings. | [ProfileScreen – element findings](./screens/ProfileScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Remove container live region, add proper tab semantics + shareable `?section=` parameter, persist last tab. | Profile Team | Sprint 48 |
| P2 | TapScreen purchase insight CTA ignores affordability, sending users to boosts they can’t buy. | [TapScreen – element findings](./screens/TapScreen.md#element-level-findings) | Tie CTA state to affordability, show saving goal, and add analytics for conversions vs deferrals. | Economy UX | Sprint 49 |
