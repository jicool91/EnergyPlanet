## 2. PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (PMF) ANALYSIS

### Current PMF Signal: **MEDIUM** (7/10)

**Strong signals:**
✅ Idle games are proven genre (billions in revenue)
✅ Telegram has massive user base and Mini App momentum
✅ Target demographic clearly defined (casual gamers)
✅ Multiple monetization vectors ready (cosmetics, boosts, battle pass)
✅ Social mechanics built in (leaderboard, clans, referral)

**Weak signals:**
⚠️ Not yet launched - no real user feedback
⚠️ No viral loops yet (referral TBD)
⚠️ Monetization not tested (price sensitivity unknown)
⚠️ Retention mechanics partially implemented (clans pending)
⚠️ Market saturation in Telegram (many mini apps launching)

### How to Validate PMF:

1. **Launch MVP with telemetry** (week 1)
   - Track D1, D7, D30 retention
   - Measure first purchase timing
   - Monitor churn reasons

2. **Early adopter feedback** (week 2-3)
   - Beta test with 100-500 real users
   - Qualitative interviews on what they like/dislike
   - Focus on retention and monetization

3. **PMF Signals to watch** (week 1-8):
   - D1 retention > 30% (indicates stickiness)
   - 5%+ conversion to first purchase (monetization works)
   - High replay rate (users open multiple times per day)
   - Positive sentiment on reviews (4.5+ stars)
   - Viral growth or word-of-mouth (users inviting friends)

## 3. PRICING STRATEGY

### Telegram Stars Pricing Model:

```
1 Telegram Star = $0.01 USD (fixed by Telegram)
```

### Product Pricing Ladder:

#### **Tier 1: Cosmetics (Low-friction)**
```
Skins/Frames/Effects:
- Common: 50 Stars ($0.50)
- Uncommon: 100 Stars ($1.00)
- Rare: 250 Stars ($2.50)

Target: 2-5% of players buy cosmetics
Average: $1.50 per buyer
```

#### **Tier 2: Energy Packs (Consumable)**
```

Target: 10-20% of active players buy (habitual)
Average: $0.30 per transaction
Frequency: 1-5x per month for buyers
```

#### **Tier 3: Premium Boosts (Time-limited)**
```
Temporary multipliers:

- Target: 5-10% of players (premium players)

Expected to drive 25-50% increase in ARPU
```

#### **Tier 5: Premium Subscription (Post-MVP)**
```

- Price: 200 Stars ($2.00) per month
- Includes: Ad-free, +50% energy cap, daily bonus energy
- Target: 2-5% of players
- Revenue per buyer: $2.00/month ongoing

Lower price = higher adoption rate
```

### Pricing Psychology Applied:

1. **Charm Pricing** (9 vs 10)
   - Energy pack: 70 Stars (not 100)
   - Boost: 200 Stars (not 250)
   - **Effect:** -25% price perception, +30% conversion

2. **Bundle Discount** (Larger = cheaper per unit)
   - 100 energy = $0.10
   - 500 energy = $0.08 per unit (20% discount)
   - **Effect:** Encourages larger purchases, +15% AOV

3. **Anchoring** (Show "original" vs "sale")
   - "7-day boost: 200 Stars (normally 280)"
   - **Effect:** Psychological win, increases conversion

4. **Strategic Scarcity**
   - Limited cosmetics (rotate monthly)
   - Battle pass has deadline (30 days)
   - **Effect:** FOMO drives purchases, +20% conversion

5. **First Purchase Incentive** (Only once)
   - First cosmetics purchase: 50% off
   - "Welcome offer: Limited time"
   - **Effect:** Lowers barrier, converts fence-sitters

### Price Optimization (A/B Testing Plan):

```
Test 1: First Purchase Offer
- Control: $1.00 cosmetics at full price
- Test A: 50% discount ($0.50)
- Test B: Free cosmetics on first level up
- Expected: Test A wins with +30% conversion

Test 2: Energy Pack Pricing
- Control: 500 energy for $0.40
- Test A: 500 energy for $0.30
- Test B: 600 energy for $0.40
- Expected: Test B wins (perceived value)

Test 3: Battle Pass Timing
- Control: Introduce month 2
- Test A: Introduce week 2
- Test B: Introduce week 4
- Expected: Week 2 = max ARPU (sweet spot)

Test 4: Boost Duration vs Price
- Control: 7-day 2x for $2.00
- Test A: 14-day 2x for $3.00
- Test B: 3-day 2x for $1.00
- Expected: 3-day test A wins (balances conversion + price)
```
